#Indian States stats

Retrieving stats of all the states from [MoHFW official website] (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

## Source www.mohfw.gov.in

I am using [www.mohfw.gov.in] (https://www.mohfw.gov.in) website because:

* It is maintained by govt officials so it is reliable.
* The accuracy of their data is close enough to actual numbers.
* They are updating their data frequently (once everyday).
