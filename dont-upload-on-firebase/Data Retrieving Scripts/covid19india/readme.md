I am using [covid19india.org](https://www.covid19india.org/) API even though they are not official because:

* They are reliable, I have cross-checked their data.
* The accuracy of their data is close enough to actual numbers.
* They are updating their data frequently (aprox. every 2 hour).




You can read FAQ's about them [here](https://www.covid19india.org/faq)


I am using their data for:
- Stats for all the Districts.
- Stats for all the Districts.
- Daily Nationwide Stats.


Note: they also have the data for daily corona tests records, will used in in Version 2.
