# Indian Districts stats

Retrieving stats of all the districts from covid19india.org [API v2] (https://api.covid19india.org/v2/state_district_wise.json).

## Source www.covid19india.org

I am using [covid19india.org] (https://www.covid19india.org/) API even though they are not official because:

* They are reliable, I have cross-checked their data.
* The accuracy of their data is close enough to actual numbers.
* They are updating their data frequently (aprox. every 2 hour).
